				"What Is Life" is a song by English rock musician George Harrison from his 1970
				triple album All Things Must Pass. In many countries, it was issued as the second
				single from the album, in February 1971, becoming a top-ten hit in the United
				States, Canada and elsewhere, and topping singles charts in Australia and
				Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, "What Is Life" appeared as the B-side to "My
				Sweet Lord", which was the best-selling single there of 1971. Harrison's backing
				musicians on the song include Eric Clapton and the entire Delaney & Bonnie and
				Friends band, with whom he had toured during the final months of the Beatles.
				Harrison co-produced the recording with Phil Specter, whose Wall of Sound production
				also employed a prominent string arrangement by John Barham and multiple acoustic
				rhythm guitars, played by Harrison's fellow Apple Records signings Badfinger.
